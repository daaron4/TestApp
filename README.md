# TestApp

I found a simple calculator app online and copied the code over. To nobody’s surprise its full of bugs and sort-of works. Imagine that you are working for the client that built this app. The project is to help them fix this app. The prompt is below:

Hi there, our new client is ‘Company X’ and we need to help them with their Android application. Here are the instructions:

1)	Clone this git repository.
2)	Open the project in Android Studio and run the app.
3)	TICKET-1: We have noticed that clicking on the “C” button before the user has clicked on any other buttons crashes the app. Please fix this.
4)	TICKET-2: Subtraction does not work in the app. Please fix this. There is an additional note here: it appears there are no unit tests to verify subtraction, multiplication, or division in our utility class: OperationHelper. Please add tests here.
5)	TICKET-3: We have noticed that our UI test, AdditionTest, does fails. Please fix this. There is an additional note here: Please add a UI test for Subtraction, since that does not yet have a UI test, and may have helped us notice TICKET-2’s issue earlier in our process.
6)	TICKET-4: The ‘%’ button appears to do nothing, please remove this.
